# ReSukiSU 35184 with latest compatible SUSFS 2.3.0

Build base: [successful run 35443096947](https://github.com/kaos2310/Super-Builders/actions/runs/35443096947),
Super-Builders `4bad7d66a2e43c6ffbcd5046ce209207ec8a590d`.
The target remains S928BXXU6ZZI4 / EUX, Android 14 / Linux 6.1.162,
with the reference full-strict KMI profile, firmware inputs and feature selection.

Immutable inputs checked on 2026-09-28:

- ReSukiSU `fa8311f632a215b5381ec644627c6198d1e8a13e`: 4484 commits + 30700 = **35184**.
- SUSFS `24743360ea08d98f6ad72b856851abed8de5854f`: latest `gki-android14-6.1` revision,
  committed 2026-09-26; its declared version remains **v2.3.0**.

The session adapter carries the reference explicit session decision, successful
exec gate, credential error propagation and WebView UID 1053 handling forward.
The upstream UAPI4 definitions, scoped driver implementation, ksud interface and
non-root capability inheritance are verified. Upstream Cargo manifests and locks
are retained, and CI builds ARM64 ksud and ksuinit with Nightly and `--locked`.
The operation-aware DynamicManager GET fix and upstream ADB-root feature remain.

SUSFS now latches the unshared-mount allocation decision before setting its
ownership flag; the Samsung namespace verifier checks that sequence. The latest
KSTAT request uses `bool is_statically`, matching ReSukiSU's native Rust request.
Enhanced KSTAT redirect uses the new `statfs_by_dentry_wrapper` and
`calculate_f_flags_wrapper`, preserving the visible filesystem's mount flags.
The new upstream fixes for statfs flags, KSTAT cleanup, allocation failures,
OPEN_REDIRECT filename lifetime, and seqlock-protected bootconfig output remain.
The overlapping ZeroMount task_mmu hook stays excluded as in the reference run.

Run `apply.py` after the pinned SUSFS patch, then `test.py` after all downstream
patches. `apply.py --verify-only` checks without applying again. Failed transforms
restore the original bytes; incorrect pins and repeated application are rejected.
CI records both exact source commits, the derived version, final config, Image
hash and required vmlinux symbols in `RESUKISU-SUSFS-INTEGRATION.json`.

Local evidence (2026-09-28): 257 session, 14 WebView and 205 KSTAT checks;
18 rejected mutations, including lost mount flags; AArch64 compilation of all
three extracted C harnesses. The integration fixture applies the exact upstream
patch plus Enhanced SUSFS and ZeroMount to AOSP
`4bd1b41bff8bb87bed8c3621fa2bb5b2e96f5d8c` with the checked-in Samsung overlay.
Windows uses Git apply with reduced context plus structural checks. CI uses
GNU patch and performs the complete kernel build, KMI and packaging gates.
Mocked C checks do not establish a successful kernel build or device boot.
